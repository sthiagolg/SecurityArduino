# alarmArduino

This is a arduino code for a security system inside the house. The photo shows how the cables should be put together in order to it work. 
If a movement is detected, the person has 5 seconds to enter the password otherwise the sound system is going to make some noise.
The system reboots by pressing "D". If you misswrite the password you can press "C" to clear it and restart.
